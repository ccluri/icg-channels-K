## Description

This is a single channel model file that was originally part of a [published model on the ModelDB website](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/mModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=50997).


The file [50997\_spike.mod](50997_spike_icgK2.mod) was extrated from [the ModelDB repository](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=50997), and committed as 50997\_spike\_icgK2.mod.

The current version of the file was modified slighly for automatic evaluation by the [icg-nrn-sim](https://github.com/icgenealogy/icg-nrn-sim) tool. To find the original please check the git history.

Since the original channel model *[50997\_spike.mod](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=50997)* contained several ionic currents, for the derived channel *50997\_spike\_icgK2.mod* we deactivated all currents except for one single remaining current.
